## About me
My name is Fr√©d√©ric Lachapelle. I've set myself to disrupt the app industry by building open source software that rivals and surpasses commercial grade software as a one man team.
I've been able to go on this journey thanks to your support! Every donation counts and even if all you can spare is one dollar, it helps tremendously. If all my users donated 1$ each, I could continue developing open-source software for the next 5 years. I am currently looking for employment and contracts in Canada, [please contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederic-lachapelle/)
